    <h2>Software </h2>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>The hardware consists of an extruded aluminum structure with steel bearing rails. A 55" Samsung display is mounted to a frame with rollers that allow it to move smoothly and easily along the rails. A Samsung Galaxy Pad S9 is attached to the back of the display along with a Phidgets High Speed encoder. The encoder encods signals from a Siko magnetic sensor which travels just above a magnetic tape that runs the length of the <frame class="">
A printed graphic is affixed to the structure just behind the display frame,  There are two damping shock absorbers at each end of the structure.
